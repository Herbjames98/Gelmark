    "summary": "The protagonist, an unremarkable security trainee in the monolithic GelCap Guild, leads a life of monotonous patrols under the constant supervision of their AI, G.R.A.C.E. This routine is violently shattered when a cataclysmic explosion engulfs the facility. The protagonist awakens to a silent, fire-ravaged ruin, discovering that the ever-present 'GG' corporate logo now feels like a trail of warning signs. This path leads them to a hidden, fire-scarred pod. G.R.A.C.E. reboots, glitchy and speaking in cryptic directives, before the pod activates, shrinking into a Gel Capsule and hurtling the protagonist through time.",
