    "summary": "The protagonist, a low-ranking and overlooked security trainee within the GelCap Guild, lives a monotonous life constantly lectured by their AI assistant, G.R.A.C.E. Their routine is shattered by a massive explosion at the facility. Waking up alone in the apocalyptic ruins, they discover the pervasive 'GG' logo, which seems to guide them to a hidden, half-melted pod. This pod, marked 'GG Hype-' and pulsing with purple light similar to G.R.A.C.E., shrinks into a Gel Capsule upon activation, triggering an uncontrolled time jump.",
