    "summary": "Chapter 4, 'The Sightless Hollow', began with Askr navigating to the Mirage Threshold Shrine for a Focus Echoform upgrade, unlocking Tier 2 Focus and the 'Echo Reflex' trait, though temporarily deactivating 'Timeline Veil'. An Echo-Tether with Thjolda revealed her potential as an Echo Key. Next, Askr journeyed to the Defense Echoform Shrine in Shatterspine Bastion, where a critical decision to save Thjolda resulted in unlocking Tier 1 Defense and the 'Dominion Anchor' trait. Relationship bonds with Caelik and Grace deepened through these events. Pursuing a bounty, Askr unlocked the 'Flamewrought Vow' trait for Thjolda, confirming her true nature. Intensive training followed, strengthening Loopborn abilities (with a new Codex entry on Grace), and boosting Askr's Defense, Speed, and Endurance to new thresholds. Combat simulations against powerful foes like the Dominion Vault Warden and The Faultmirror Sovereign honed Askr's skills, culminating in the fusion of 'Coreborn' and 'Fractured Flame Sigil' into the epic 'Ashcore Verdict' artifact.",
