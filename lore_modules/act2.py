    "summary": "The protagonist is forced into labor in the Gæl Mines, where they develop their physical and mental capabilities through grueling tasks, earning trust. They craft a Makeshift Charger to partially reactivate G.R.A.C.E., who begins to whisper instructions. Just as the protagonist nears acceptance into the Viking military, alien invaders known as the Pakariin arrive, initially leaving after seeking a 'sealed king'. However, they soon return to enforce total submission, re-enslaving the camp and conscripting the protagonist. With G.R.A.C.E. reaching 50% power and full memory, she reveals the Pakariin's past presence and links it to the future's destruction. The protagonist sets out to find and awaken the legendary Frozen King, who once repelled the invaders, preparing for a confrontation with the Valking Captain.",
