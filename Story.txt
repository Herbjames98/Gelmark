🔹 Main Character Summary

    A low-ranking security trainee working under the massive tech empire, GelCap Guild (GG).

    Considered untalented and irrelevant by their peers.

    Constantly shadowed by a personal AI assistant:
    G.R.A.C.E. – Gelcap Robot Assistant for Cognitive Enhancement, a floating disk-shaped bot glowing with soft purple light.

    Secret truth (unknown to the character or reader for a long time):
    They are the illegitimate child of the current CEO, born of a corporate affair and planted within the system as a “bloodline fallback” in case something happens to the main family.

🔹 Prologue: Routine & Rejection

    Daily life consists of monotonous patrols, basic training drills, and constant lectures from G.R.A.C.E.

    The protagonist is looked down upon, seen as a failed investment or charity case.

    The “GG” symbol (GelCap Guild logo) is a common sight, mostly used to mark restricted or classified zones.

🔹 Inciting Incident: The Explosion

    During a regular lesson from G.R.A.C.E., a massive explosion rocks the facility.

    The protagonist is knocked unconscious amid collapsing structures and flickering emergency lights.

🔹 Chapter One: Aftermath in Silence

    Waking up alone, the protagonist finds the facility in apocalyptic ruin.

    Everything is on fire — but disturbingly quiet.
    There are no screams. Everyone is already dead.

    As they stumble through the wreckage, they begin brushing off walls and terminals, repeatedly revealing the "GG" logo.

    The logo begins to feel more like a warning marker, guiding them to something forbidden.

🔹 The Hidden Pod

    In a deeply buried, fire-scarred chamber, they find a strange, half-melted pod.

    Marked on the side, they barely make out the burned text:

        "GG Hype-" (the rest destroyed)

    The pod pulses faintly with purple light, identical to the glow of G.R.A.C.E. and GelCap prototype tech.

    G.R.A.C.E. reboots, but she’s vague and glitchy:

        “Tactical fallback unit... viable but unstable.”

        “Shrink-class transport... recommended. Minimal survivability threshold met.”

    When activated, the pod shrinks down into a glowing purple sphere — a Gel Capsule, the compact future tech used to store and transport items or people.
    The protagonist does not understand what’s happening, only that they must escape.

🔹 Time Travel

    The protagonist is consumed in light and sound.
    Time bends. Reality breaks.
    They are thrown back through centuries.

🔹 Chapter Two: The Ancient Past

    They awaken in a cold forest clearing at night.

    Surrounded by wild terrain and no tech — they’ve landed in the Viking Age.

    In the distance: torchlight, chanting, wooden settlements.

🔹 The Gel Helmets

    While hiding, the protagonist observes warriors wearing helmets padded with strange purple gel.

    G.R.A.C.E., scanning in low-power mode, remarks:

        “Composition matches GelCap substance… primitive, unrefined… but unmistakable.”

        “These warriors… may be the first.”

    These Vikings are unknowingly the ancestors of the GelCap Guild, naming their tribe after the purple gel that gave them an edge in war.

🔹 Grace’s Sacrifice

    G.R.A.C.E., nearly depleted, flies off into the darkness.

    She returns at dawn with:

        A Viking helmet lined with the purple gel

        Crude clothes and supplies

    She tells the protagonist:

        “I can enable you to understand them… but it will cost everything else.”

        “To maintain translation, I must shut down all other systems.”

    The protagonist hesitates, then agrees.

    G.R.A.C.E. lands on their chest, gently powers down, leaving only her translation module active.
    Her purple glow fades as she whispers:

        “You are not alone. I will speak for you… until I can’t.”

🔹 **End of Act One: Meeting the Vikings

    Armed with language and disguise, the protagonist begins walking toward the Viking camp.

    They have no idea they are woven into the foundation of GelCap Guild's ancient origin… or what secrets the past will force them to uncover.
