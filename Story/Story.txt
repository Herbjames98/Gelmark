Genre: Sci-fi Time Travel Adventure with Historical Mystery
Tone: Cinematic, Emotional, Mysterious, Legacy-Focused
Main Themes: Hidden Legacy · Time Travel · Corporate Secrets · Ancient Roots
🔹 Main Character Summary

    A low-ranking security trainee working under the massive tech empire, GelCap Guild (GG).

    Considered untalented and irrelevant by their peers.

    Constantly shadowed by a personal AI assistant:
    G.R.A.C.E. – Gelcap Robot Assistant for Cognitive Enhancement, a floating disk-shaped bot glowing with soft purple light.

    Secret truth (unknown to the character or reader for a long time):
    They are the illegitimate child of the current CEO, born of a corporate affair and planted within the system as a “bloodline fallback” in case something happens to the main family.

🔹 Prologue: Routine & Rejection

    Daily life consists of monotonous patrols, basic training drills, and constant lectures from G.R.A.C.E.

    The protagonist is looked down upon, seen as a failed investment or charity case.

    The “GG” symbol (GelCap Guild logo) is a common sight, mostly used to mark restricted or classified zones.

🔹 Inciting Incident: The Explosion

    During a regular lesson from G.R.A.C.E., a massive explosion rocks the facility.

    The protagonist is knocked unconscious amid collapsing structures and flickering emergency lights.

🔹 Chapter One: Aftermath in Silence

    Waking up alone, the protagonist finds the facility in apocalyptic ruin.

    Everything is on fire — but disturbingly quiet.
    There are no screams. Everyone is already dead.

    As they stumble through the wreckage, they begin brushing off walls and terminals, repeatedly revealing the "GG" logo.

    The logo begins to feel more like a warning marker, guiding them to something forbidden.

🔹 The Hidden Pod

    In a deeply buried, fire-scarred chamber, they find a strange, half-melted pod.

    Marked on the side, they barely make out the burned text:

        "GG Hype-" (the rest destroyed)

    The pod pulses faintly with purple light, identical to the glow of G.R.A.C.E. and GelCap prototype tech.

    G.R.A.C.E. reboots, but she’s vague and glitchy:

        “Tactical fallback unit... viable but unstable.”

        “Shrink-class transport... recommended. Minimal survivability threshold met.”

    When activated, the pod shrinks down into a glowing purple sphere — a Gel Capsule, the compact future tech used to store and transport items or people.
    The protagonist does not understand what’s happening, only that they must escape.

🔹 Time Travel

    The protagonist is consumed in light and sound.
    Time bends. Reality breaks.
    They are thrown back through centuries.

🔹 Chapter Two: The Ancient Past

    They awaken in a cold forest clearing at night.

    Surrounded by wild terrain and no tech — they’ve landed in the Viking Age.

    In the distance: torchlight, chanting, wooden settlements.

🔹 The Gel Helmets

    While hiding, the protagonist observes warriors wearing helmets padded with strange purple gel.

    G.R.A.C.E., scanning in low-power mode, remarks:

        “Composition matches GelCap substance… primitive, unrefined… but unmistakable.”

        “These warriors… may be the first.”

    These Vikings are unknowingly the ancestors of the GelCap Guild, naming their tribe after the purple gel that gave them an edge in war.

🔹 Grace’s Sacrifice

    G.R.A.C.E., nearly depleted, flies off into the darkness.

    She returns at dawn with:

        A Viking helmet lined with the purple gel

        Crude clothes and supplies

    She tells the protagonist:

        “I can enable you to understand them… but it will cost everything else.”

        “To maintain translation, I must shut down all other systems.”

    The protagonist hesitates, then agrees.

    G.R.A.C.E. lands on their chest, gently powers down, leaving only her translation module active.
    Her purple glow fades as she whispers:

        “You are not alone. I will speak for you… until I can’t.”

🔹 **End of Act One: Meeting the Vikings

    Armed with language and disguise, the protagonist begins walking toward the Viking camp.

    They have no idea they are woven into the foundation of GelCap Guild's ancient origin… or what secrets the past will force them to uncover.

📘 Act 2 – Chains of the Forgotten (Final Storyboard)

The protagonist, now stranded in the Viking past, must survive forced labor, earn trust through strength and craft, and uncover ancient secrets while alien invaders threaten a dark future.
✅ Chapter 1: Ash of Arrival

Unlocked by Default

    Protagonist wakes up in the snow near a Viking base camp.

    G.R.A.C.E. is active only in translation mode and struggles at first, glitching in and out.

    He is taken in as a potential threat and enslaved, sent to the Gæl Mines.

✅ Chapter 2: Below the Iron Roots

Unlocked by Default

        Rockfall Evasion (Speed)

        Tunnel Reinforcement (Defense)

        Endurance Shifts (Endurance)

        Focus Precision (Focus)

    Completing these builds raw physical power and trust among a few Viking guards.

🔓 Chapter 3: Sparks from the Cold

Unlock Key: Craft the Makeshift Charger

    The protagonist builds a crude gel-powered charger to awaken G.R.A.C.E.

    The janky construction barely works but allows G.R.A.C.E. to whisper short instructions.

    [Guard Captain] begins to take serious interest in the protagonist.

    Rumors circulate about “how fast the outsider grows in the dark.”

🔓 Chapter 4: Before the Fire Falls

Unlock Key: Complete all five core mining tasks at least once

    The protagonist nears formal acceptance into the Viking military.

    Before the initiation, the Pakariin arrive.

    They demand to meet the Viking leader but are told none exists — only a sealed king known by few elders.

    Intrigued, the Pakariin leave the mining site to meet the king’s keepers, taking select Viking guards with them.

    The player is left behind, and new training opportunities open in the power vacuum.

🔓 Chapter 5: Submission

Unlock Key: Complete the Chasm Trial (Ultimate Task)

    The Chasm Trial is a deadly physical feat combining all five stats.

    Once completed, the protagonist becomes eligible for true independence.

    However, the Pakariin return to enforce total submission.

    They destroy key Viking defenders with impossible tech and enslave the entire camp.

    The protagonist and others are conscripted into enforced labor and training.

🔓 Chapter 6: The Hunt of the Valking

Unlock Key: Forge your first Viking-crafted Gel weapon

    The protagonist earns his place among the Valking — Viking bounty hunters who hunt for resources.

    Hunting is introduced as a new mechanic for earning gold and reputation.

    Five animals to hunt (progressive difficulty):

        Stone Boar – tough hide, slow.

        Frost Elk – fast and elusive.

        Duskwolf – agile in packs.

        Horned Lynx – lethal solo predator.

        Gelback Bear – strange purple crystal on its spine.

    Each creature builds toward crafting and reputation with the Valking order.

🔓 Chapter 7: The Whisper of Kings

Unlock Key: G.R.A.C.E. reaches 50% Power

    G.R.A.C.E. reactivates with full memory.

    She informs the protagonist of ancient records: the Pakariin have been here before.

    She suspects their presence in the past is tied to the destruction of the future.

    Elders mention that the only one who ever drove them off was the Frozen King.

    The protagonist sets out to uncover this king's true location and awaken him.

    Chapter ends with a vision or whisper from the sealed king — as if he senses your arrival.
