**CHAPTER ONE – ROUTINE, THEN RUIN**

They always told me I should be grateful.

I was. In theory.

A roof over my head, three meals, and a corporate badge with my name on it—gray-tier, sure, not blue like the real staff, but still. I wore the GelCap Guild logo on my chest. That had to count for something.

Right?

> “Trainee \[Player name], your foot is off by point-zero-three degrees. Again.”

G.R.A.C.E.’s voice crackled in my ear—polished, artificial, perfectly insufferable. She hovered behind me like always: a smooth disc of purple light, floating like an obedient moon. She was my assistant, my monitor, my constant critic.

I adjusted my stance.

> “Better. Inefficient, but better.”

That was the fifth correction today. We were on routine patrol—Zone 3 perimeter, sealed storage. No one ever came this far out. The halls stretched in sterile silence, humming with regulated oxygen and the distant whisper of power cores.

And there it was again—every ten steps: GG. GelCap Guild. Glowing on every wall. Watching. Reminding.

> “Repeat protocol 19B.”

I mumbled it, out of habit.

> “Again. Audibly. \[Player name], training metrics require—”

“I *know* the protocol,” I snapped. Then caught myself.

No response. Just a slight recalibration hum.

I looked up. Overhead, behind transparent polymer, rows of prototype capsules floated in stasis. Violet glows pulsed from within. Untouchable tech. Legacy-grade. The kind reserved for those who mattered.

Not me.

I was a filler name in the system. Someone plugged in to tick a quota. A living backup file.

> “You're drifting.”

I was about to mutter something back when the lights flickered—then the floor trembled.

A low pulse. Like distant thunder.

I froze. G.R.A.C.E. paused mid-hover. Her purple glow flared.

Then the second tremor hit.

*Hard.*

An explosion—closer this time. The corridor lit up in white-hot bursts, followed by a crashing boom that shook the air out of my lungs. Walls buckled. Metal warped. Somewhere behind me, a scream cut short.

Then they came.

Shadows.

Tall. Inhuman. Moving through the smoke with deliberate force. I couldn’t see them clearly—only their massive outlines and the faint shimmer of what looked like armor… no, helmets.

But not helmets.

The shapes flexed. Shifted.

I thought I saw one *breathe.*

Their heads were large, bulbous, and unnatural—like curved ivory domes draped with flowing, tendril-like folds. They rippled as the figures moved, as if reacting to sound. Or scent.

I stumbled backward, heart hammering. One of them turned. Slowly.

Its “helmet” twitched toward me.

And then I ran.

I didn’t stop to think. I barely heard G.R.A.C.E. shouting through static as the air filled with fire and shrapnel. I dove through a collapsing bulkhead, rolling into a secondary corridor that was already falling apart.

---

I woke up… later. In silence.

The facility was in ruin. Rubble everywhere. My limbs ached like I’d been dropped from orbit.

No alarms. No voices.

No enemies.

Just smoke. And the soft, flickering pulse of the GG logo on every broken wall like some corporate ghost that had survived the massacre.

“G.R.A.C.E.?” I croaked.

No reply.

I climbed to my feet, coughing on dust. I stumbled forward, through corridor after corridor—half of them caved in. I kept seeing it. That purple glow.

But then something… changed.

A faint pulse. Different. Lower. Almost… rhythmic.

I followed it instinctively, deeper into a collapsed maintenance wing. A curved wall panel blinked once as I passed it. Then again. On the third blink, a single line of text flickered into visibility—**\[Access: EyeScan Required]**.

“What the—” I leaned in. There was no visible scanner.

Then I heard her.

> “...biometric match… fallback sequence pending...”

Her voice. Faint. G.R.A.C.E.

I placed my face close to the wall.

A blue-white beam sliced across my right eye.

> “Scan accepted.”

There was a mechanical click, and a section of the wall *dissolved*. Not slid open—*dissolved*, like a holographic decoy peeling away to reveal something real underneath.

Behind it: a burned-out room, half-crushed by falling beams. And there, lodged in melted flooring, was a strange curved shape. Shimmering. Flickering.

I approached slowly.

It wasn’t tech I recognized—not at first. But then the scorch marks cleared just enough to reveal a symbol.

Half-erased, but familiar.

> **“GG Hype—”**

That’s all that remained.

> “...viable... but unstable…”

G.R.A.C.E. again.

Her glow flickered above the wreckage—barely visible. She was damaged. Glitching. But still holding on.

> “Tactical fallback… shrink-class transport… survivability threshold met...”

The pod pulsed. Once. Then again.

It folded inward on itself, plates sliding and clicking until it became a sphere — a smooth, humming orb of light.

I didn’t know what I was holding.
Didn’t know what would happen.
I just knew that whatever those things were… they hadn’t come from this world.
And I didn’t want to stay in it.

I closed my hand around it.

The light swallowed everything.
