act_name_lore = {
    "summary": "",
    "major_events": [],
    # ... and so on
}```

This is the simplest, cleanest, and most reliable way to store your data. It is a "data-only" file.

### How It Works with Your `gelmark_engine.py`

Your main application script (`gelmark_engine.py`) is the "engine" that does all the work. It contains the intelligent `load_data_from_file` function that is specifically designed to read these simple template files.

Here's the process:
1.  **You create a new file**, like `act4.py`, using the simple template. You rename the variable to `act4_lore = { ... }`.
2.  **Your `gelmark_engine.py` script starts.**
3.  The `render_lore_browser` function in your engine script automatically scans the `lore_modules` folder and finds your new `act4.py` file.
4.  It then uses the `load_data_from_file` function to **intelligently import** your `act4.py` file and specifically extract the `act4_lore` dictionary from it.

**In short: Yes, the simple template I provided is exactly what your powerful engine script is designed to work with.**

### The Definitive, Reusable Template

To be absolutely clear, here is the blank template again. You can have full confidence that this is the correct and final version to use for all your future act files.

**Instructions:**
1.  Inside your `my_gm/lore_modules/` folder, create a new file (e.g., `act4.py`).
2.  Copy and paste the entire code block below into the new file.
3.  **Change the first line** to match the name of your file (e.g., `act4_lore = {`).

```python
# This is the blank template for a new lore act.
# IMPORTANT: Rename the variable 'act_name_lore' to match the file.
# For example, in 'act4.py', this should be 'act4_lore'.
